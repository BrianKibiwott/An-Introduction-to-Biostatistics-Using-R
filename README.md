Biostatistics - Why? What? How?


This is a series of lectures and seminars designed for B.Sc. sudents of biology and should serve as an introduction to the basics of biostatistics using R. I teach these topics at the University of Leipzig but invite everyone who stumbles across this repository to make use of what I'm presenting here as all of my material has been designed with the students interest in mind and should thus be self-sufficient.



The material presented here is aimed at providing the reader with:


1 A solid grasp of basic biostatistics

-> Have an overview of available methods

-> Be able to judge the applicability of individual methods

2 Basic proficiency in using R

-> Know base commands and how they function

-> Be able to prepare biologically relevant data sets for further analysis

-> Be able to apply basic statistical methods to biologically relevant data sets

3 Research Design

-> Understand how to formulate testable hypotheses

-> Know the importance of proper statistical approaches in research

-> Being able to critically assess statistical methods in research publications



The seminar series covers the following:


I.) Introduction

  (1) An Introduction to Basic Statistics for Biologists
  
  (2) Introduction to R
  
II.) Basic statistical terminology

  (3) A primer for Statistical Tests
  
  (4) Descriptive Statistics
  
  (5) Data Visualisation
  
  (6) Inferential Statistics, Hypotheses and our Research Project
  
III.) Handling Data

  (7) Data Handling and Data Mining
  
IV.) Non-parametric tests

  (8) Nominal Tests
  
  (9) Correlation Tests
  
  (10) Ordinal and Metric Tests for two-sample situations
  
  (11) Ordinal and Metric Tests for more than two-sample situations
  
V.) Parametric tests

  (12) Simple Parametric Tests
  
VI.) Closing

  (13) Summary, Manuscript Workflow and an Outlook on Advanced Statistics
